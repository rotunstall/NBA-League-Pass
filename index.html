          An Early History -- <small>1946 to 1957</small>
        </h3>
        <p class="league-info-text">
          The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the pre-eminent men's
          professional basketball league in North America, and is widely
          considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in
          the world. It has 30 franchised member clubs (29 in the United
          States and 1 in Canada), and is an active member of USA Basketball
          (USAB), which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International
          Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball
          in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major North
          American professional sports leagues. NBA players are the world's
          best paid sportsmen, by average annual salary per player. The league
          was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball
          Association of America (BAA). The league adopted the name National
          Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with its
          rival National Basketball League (NBL).
        </p>
        <p>
          The league's several international as well as individual team
          offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic
          Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. NBA Entertainment and
          NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New
          Jersey. The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by
          owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and
          Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in
          Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York
          Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now regards
          as the first played in its history. The first basket was made by
          Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been
          earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the
          American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league
          to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not
          significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading
          independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance,
          the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won
          that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis
          Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948-49 season, however,
          NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester
          jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice
          for collegians looking to turn professional. The headquarters of the
          National Basketball Association in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth
          Avenue, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, USA. Following the 1948-49
          season, the BAA took in the remainder of the NBL: Syracuse,
          Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo. In deference
          to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league
          name was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball Association
          in spite of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large
          and small cities, as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and
          armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a
          process that continued until 1953–54, when the league reached its
          smallest size of eight franchises, all of which are still in the
          league (the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Golden State Warriors,
          Los Angeles Lakers, Royals/Kings, Detroit Pistons, Atlanta Hawks,
          and Nationals/76ers). The process of contraction saw the league's
          smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted
          from 'Tri-Cities' (the area now known as the Quad Cities) to
          Milwaukee (in 1951) and then to St. Louis, Missouri (in 1955); the
          Royals from Rochester, New York to Cincinnati (in 1957); and the
          Pistons from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Detroit (in 1957).
        </p>

          Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the
          1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks. He remained
          the only non-white player in league history prior to the first
          African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington
          Capitols in 1950. Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,
          but several African-American players did play in the league later
          that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel
          'Sweetwater' Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the
          Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led
          by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established
          themselves as the league's first dynasty. To encourage shooting and
          discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock
          in 1954. If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the
          ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of
          obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its
          opponent.
